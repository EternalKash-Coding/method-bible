5 miles meetup app method
This is a high risk high reward method right here. 
	1.	Download the 5 miles app it should be an orange area around a white 5
	2.	Create and account with a zip code far from you. Make sure not to use a zip code near you.
	3.	List as many items as u want for whatever price. Personally i listed phones and shoes because that’s what i actually have and can prove verification for if anybody is fishy
	4.	when you begin to get people who ask is it available, tell them yes. have small conversation with them and try to persuade them to buying away from the 5 miles app using cashapp or apple pay or paypal friendly transaction 
	5.	Some words or sentences you can say are “i’m a minor and i just got a new ___ i really just wanna give this ____ away for some money” or “ hey i don’t have a payment method set up on here but i have a cashapp and apple pay and i can provide a tracking number for your package the next day after you pay” 
	6.	Collect many screenshots of tracking numbers or verification for the item your selling. You don’t want to get caught slipping and then they refuse to buy. Like i said earlier this is a high risk high reward method.

Here is an example of a lady buying a phone from me off of 5 miles. I persuaded her to buy an iphone 11 for so cheap she had to hop on the opportunity instantly. She cashapp’d me after i proved verification i had the phone (with the help of someone with the phone) and she sent the money. Of course i had to have small talk at first before she bought it but that’s part of the process.
	8.	When you receive the payment instantly block the people and do not carry on conversation
	9.	You should probably fake your identity while doing this as well 
	10.	There are bots on this app who like to say “kindly message me” or some other phrases. If they are asking for you to send them something with your item it is a scam. Do not fall for it.
	11.	Any other Questions you can hit up @methodsbyian thank you people let’s all eat together 💪🏾👨🏽‍💻
