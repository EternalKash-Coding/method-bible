Ebay Method üí≥üî• 
	‚ÅÉ	@jankyydave @kashdami
Rd yungans heres watchu need:

	1.	A good CC with fuulz or a Paypal Account (Adress, Phone #, Card info etc)
	2.	Good communication skills
	3.	Good VPN cyberghost cracked ia amazing for this stuff. (Look up a yt video)

Okay. Time to get into tha real shit. 

	1.	If u buy a PayPal account off of me the order will probably go thru a lot more frequently . You can buy them for $180.
	2.	You could also buy a CC off of me or buy the CC method, but u also will need an ebay bin if u want to succeed. Easier. If you live in the US buy a cc a state away, same thing for UK people.

-
	1.	Get Cyberghost 
	2.	Turn cyberghost on 
	3.	If the PP account or CC you bought is from UK make sure ur vpn is in the same country, but if its from the US u have to make sure its AT LEAST in the same state! Even then u might wannt to get within 25 miles of cardholder address. 
	4.	Pick your first product. It has to be less than $100. It CANNOT BE A GIFTCARD OR IT WILL GET FLAGGED !!!! . Put it in your cart. Come back in 5 hours and purchase it.
	5.	When your purchasing make sure the billing and shipping is the cardholder's address is used. Not your drop or real adress.
	6.	If your order has gone thru successfully ‚úÖ you have made thru the first half.
	7.	Wait 30 minutes and text the seller that you have recently moved and you put in your old address. Say you will leave 5/5 feedback if you change the adress to: (YOUR DROP). 
	8.	If the seller agress then success ‚úÖ you have successfully completed the method! If it didnt go thru, repeat with a different vendor! 

PS: u wont hit everytime! But eventually u will hit!
