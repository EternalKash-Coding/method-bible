🅿️AYPAL METHOD 2020 🔥💳 

	⁃	jankyydave @kashdami.

	1.	Buy A PayPal Account From @jankyydave on snap or @kashdami_ on ig
	2.	Download G2A app for android/IOS – Don’t use the normal browser on mobile, it will defeat the purpose.
	3.	Set VPN on closest area of PayPal account. It seems it works as long as you are in the same country at least. If it’s a USA account then try to be in same state.
	4.	Use the PayPal fulls as your identity in g2a 
	5.	Create a new account on g2a with another email address and verify the email address. You must use a fake email address and NOT the Email address of the PayPal account.
	6.	Go to profile page and enter the details of the PayPal accountholder.
	7.	Proceed to the marketplace and select some eGiftCards – Steam, Amazon and ITunes carry the most value at exchanges. Keep the total amount of the purchase below $250 per transaction. It seems like they request verification for transactions above $250.
	8.	Go to checkout and choose PayPal as your method of payment. It will take you to the PayPal checkout page where you will be asked to enter your PayPal logins. Enter the details and pay!! It will be successful 60% of the time!!
E-Giftcard codes are delivered instantly on the checkout page after successful payment!!
Go to paxful.com or paxum.com to sell your egift codes for BTC!! No verification required!
Two reasons why this is successful is :
– You can use a different PayPal email address than the email of your G2A account. – Giftcards are delivered instantly and no verification process will be conducted.

PS. Remember guys: Fraud and cashing out stolen Accounts and Cards are Always a Gamble!! Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t!! For unknown reasons payments will decline and we have to accept that we cannot cashout 100% of the time!
If u have the PP info u can always send the money to another paypal, this way is just more secure and untraceable.
